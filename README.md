# M.E.M.O.R.Y.-Bot-
M.E.M.O.R.Y. Bot is a recreational program that I created as a birthday gift for a friend sent over Discord. The program is designed to prompt the user to list memories with the gift recipient to create a memory consisting of a time, title, and image hyperlink. The program will generate a random memory per the user's request. 
Whilst the program does require Discord to function as a bot, the program is designed with a private channel in mind to plan a message for the recipient ahead of time. Development of this program is indefinitely postponed and this code will be either archived or used as a base reference for a rebranded, more elaborate project. This code is posted publicly for reference or inspiration for other users.
